###Introduction:


###Analysis:

First lets set things up
```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(ggfortify)
library(readr)
```


##Analysis 1:

1. pull in data

```{r}
WsSpC <- read.csv(here("Data", "Processed Data", "DF_WsSpC.csv"))
```

2. plot expected relationships

```{r}
ggplot(WsSpC, aes(x = Watershed, y=Species))+
     geom_point()+
  xlab("Watershed")+
  ylab("Species")
```


3. guess expected relationships (hypothesis)

I think there will not be a significant difference in Species composition between Watersheds.

4. decide on statistical model and test and explain why

This will be a chi squared test because both Watershed and Species are catagorical nominal variables.

5. check model assumptions

6. run stat model

7. interpret model results (were expected relationships supported?)

8. replot data to show key relationships
